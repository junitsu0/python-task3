# --- Honestly I don't have time for this and forgot the 101 things I did before class.
# --- Though I generally disagree with graded assignments before class would even begin,
# --- or the topic not even covered, sincerely this was a time issue. I don't have enough.
# --- Also, I did not want to just cut/paste some answer in without knowing how it works.
# --- So, although I don't like the idea of missing an entire assignment of points,
# --- because I genuinely want to perform well and learn all I can,
# --- I will have to take the hit on this one and just be stellar afterwards.
